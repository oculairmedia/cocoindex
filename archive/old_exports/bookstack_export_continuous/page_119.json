This information is then passed to MCP to retrieve detailed tool information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bkmrk-mcp-to-bookstack\">MCP to Bookstack</h3>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-mcp-provides-direct-\">MCP provides direct access to tool metadata, which is formatted into documentation and added to Bookstack. This documentation includes usage examples, parameters, limitations, and version history.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bkmrk-bookstack-to-graphit\">Bookstack to Graphiti</h3>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-changes-in-bookstack\">Changes in Bookstack are synchronized with Graphiti through webhooks. When new documentation is added or existing documentation is updated in Bookstack, a webhook triggers the ingestion process in Graphiti.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bkmrk-benefits\">Benefits</h2>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-this-architecture-pr\">This architecture provides several benefits:</p>\n<ol id=\"bkmrk-automated-documentat\">\n<li><strong>Automated Documentation</strong>: Reduces manual effort in maintaining tool documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ensures that documentation is consistent across Bookstack and Graphiti.</li>\n<li><strong>Discoverability</strong>: Improves tool discovery through semantic search in Weaviate and structured documentation in Bookstack.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Simplifies maintenance through automated updates and synchronization.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"bkmrk-future-enhancements\">Future Enhancements</h2>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-potential-future-enh\">Potential future enhancements include:</p>\n<ol id=\"bkmrk-advanced-search%3A-imp\">\n<li><strong>Advanced Search</strong>: Implement more advanced search capabilities in Graphiti to find related tools and documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: Improve versioning support to track changes in tool descriptions over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Enhance error handling and notification mechanisms for failed documentation updates.</li>\n<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: Develop a user interface for managing the pipeline and reviewing documentation.</li>\n</ol>\n",
