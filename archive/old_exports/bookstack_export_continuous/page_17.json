Use non-blocking calls whenever possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to catch and manage exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timeouts: Set appropriate timeouts for asynchronous calls to prevent indefinite waiting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Message Queues: Use message queues to handle tasks asynchronously. This allows you to decouple the sender and receiver, improving reliability and scalability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track the performance and health of your asynchronous system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Context Management: Be mindful of context when working with asynchronous operations. Ensure that you're passing the correct context and handling it appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Testing: Thoroughly test your asynchronous code to ensure it behaves as expected under various conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cancellation: Implement mechanisms to cancel asynchronous tasks if needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Resource Management: Properly manage resources (e.g., connections, threads) to avoid leaks and ensure efficient use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-these-best-practices\">These best practices will help you build reliable and efficient asynchronous communication systems within Letta.</p>\n",
