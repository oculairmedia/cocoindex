# Current Pipeline Blocker Analysis

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED - Interactive Setup Blocking Issue Resolved

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Docker containers are healthy (FalkorDB, PostgreSQL, Pipeline)
- BookStack JSON export files exist (153 pages exported)
- CocoIndex flow setup completes successfully
- Ollama connectivity is confirmed
- LlmSpec configuration fixed (using `address` parameter correctly)
- Environment variables properly configured

### Current Blocker üö´

**Issue**: Pipeline stops after CocoIndex setup phase and never proceeds to actual data processing.

**Symptoms**:
```
Setup is already up to date.
[Pipeline execution stops here - no further processing]
```

**Expected Behavior**: After setup, the pipeline should:
1. Process 153 JSON files through CocoIndex
2. Run Ollama LLM extraction on each document
3. Create Episodic and Entity nodes in FalkorDB
4. Generate MENTIONS relationships

### Technical Details

**Startup Script Flow**:
```bash
# ‚úÖ Works: Setup phase
echo "y" | cocoindex update --setup "$FLOW_FILE"

# ‚ùå Blocked: Execution phase
cocoindex update "$FLOW_FILE"  # <- This command never executes
```

**Container Status**:
- Status: `Up About a minute (health: starting)`
- Process appears to hang after setup completion
- No error messages in logs

### Investigation Needed

1. **Interactive Mode Issue**: CocoIndex setup may be waiting for interactive input despite `echo "y"` pipe
2. **Process Hanging**: The update command after setup may be stuck in a blocking state
3. **Flow Configuration**: Enhanced Ollama flow may have configuration issues preventing execution

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Manual Test**: Execute `cocoindex update flows/bookstack_enhanced_ollama.py` directly in container
2. **Debug Setup**: Check if setup is actually waiting for additional confirmation
3. **Flow Validation**: Verify the enhanced flow configuration is valid
4. **Alternative**: Switch to simple pipeline mode to test if basic functionality works

### Impact

- **Data Quality**: Clean enhanced LLM processing blocked
- **Integration**: Cannot populate FalkorDB with proper Graphiti schema
- **Timeline**: Pipeline deployment stalled until execution phase works

### Environment Context

- **BookStack**: 153 pages ready for processing
- **Ollama**: Gemma3:12b model available at external host
- **FalkorDB**: Graph `graphiti_migration` ready for data
- **CocoIndex**: Enhanced flow configured but not executing

*Status: Investigating execution phase hang after successful setup*

## Findings and Root Cause ‚úÖ

- The startup script uses an interactive setup pattern: `echo "y" | cocoindex update --setup "$FLOW_FILE"` with a fallback to a fully interactive call on failure. If the pipe fails (e.g., additional confirmations, non‚ÄëTTY behavior), the fallback `cocoindex update --setup "$FLOW_FILE"` blocks waiting for input inside a non‚Äëinteractive container. As a result, the next line (`cocoindex update "$FLOW_FILE"`) never runs.
- CocoIndex CLI already exposes a non‚Äëinteractive flag `--force` for setup. Using `--force` skips all prompts and avoids hanging.
- Directory mismatch: the enhanced flow reads from `bookstack_export_full/` but the exporter defaults to `bookstack_export/`. If you export inside the container without overriding `--out`, the flow may see zero files. Aligning the export directory avoids silent no‚Äëop runs.
- Healthcheck script looks for a Python process with a specific pattern (`python.*bookstack`), but the long‚Äërunning process is `cocoindex update`. This can cause misleading ‚Äúhealth: starting‚Äù even when the pipeline is fine.

## Fixes to Apply üîß

1) Make setup non‚Äëinteractive and resilient

- Replace the interactive setup with `--force` and remove the fully interactive fallback.

```bash
# start-pipeline.sh (lines ~79‚Äì85)
# BEFORE
# echo "y" | cocoindex update --setup "$FLOW_FILE" || {
#   echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CocoIndex setup failed, trying manual confirmation..."
#   cocoindex update --setup "$FLOW_FILE"
# }

# AFTER (non-interactive + retry window)
cocoindex update --setup --force "$FLOW_FILE" || {
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CocoIndex setup failed, retrying in 60s..."
  sleep 60
}
```

- Also update the simple startup script:

```bash
# start-pipeline-simple.sh (inside the while loop)
# BEFORE
# echo "y" | cocoindex update --setup flows/bookstack_ollama_simple.py || {
#   echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Setup failed, retrying in 60s..."
#   sleep 60
#   continue
# }

# AFTER
cocoindex update --setup --force flows/bookstack_ollama_simple.py || {
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Setup failed, retrying in 60s..."
  sleep 60
  continue
}
```

2) Align export directory with the flow input

- The enhanced flow reads from `bookstack_export_full/` (see flows/bookstack_enhanced_ollama.py). Ensure the exporter writes there:

```bash
# start-pipeline.sh (export step)
python scripts/bookstack_export.py --limit 200 --out bookstack_export_full
```

- Alternatively, change the flow‚Äôs LocalFile source to `bookstack_export/` if you prefer that path, but keep compose volume mounts consistent.

3) Improve healthcheck to reflect the actual process

- Consider checking for the cocoindex process or recent logs instead of a specific Python pattern.

```bash
# docker-healthcheck.sh
if ! pgrep -f "cocoindex update" >/dev/null; then
  echo "Pipeline process not running"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Validation Steps ‚úÖ

- One‚Äëshot run:

```bash
cocoindex update --setup --force flows/bookstack_enhanced_ollama.py
cocoindex update flows/bookstack_enhanced_ollama.py
```

- Live sync:

```bash
cocoindex update flows/bookstack_enhanced_ollama.py -L
```

- Quick FalkorDB spot checks (from a redis-cli):

```bash
GRAPH.QUERY graphiti_migration "MATCH (d:Episodic) RETURN count(d)"
GRAPH.QUERY graphiti_migration "MATCH (d:Episodic)-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity) RETURN count(e)"
```

## Status Update

- Expected outcome after these changes:
  - Setup runs non‚Äëinteractively and returns control to the script
  - Exported files are discovered by the flow
  - Health reflects the actual running updater
  - The second `cocoindex update` and the live run are reached and execute
