While scheduled deduplication, merging, and graph optimization are not essential for small deployments, they are critical for large-scale, long-running systems. this was created while on my way why is the webhook integration slowing it down</p>\r\n<h2 id=\"bkmrk-why-optimization-mat\">Why Optimization Matters</h2>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-reduces-redundant-or\">\r\n<li>Reduces redundant or fragmented memories</li>\r\n<li>Keeps queries fast and results accurate</li>\r\n<li>Ensures cost-effective use of Neo4j resources</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 id=\"bkmrk-recommended-approach\">Recommended Approaches</h2>\r\n<ul id=\"bkmrk-periodic-deduplicati\">\r\n<li>Periodic deduplication scripts (using Python or Cypher) to merge similar nodes and relationships</li>\r\n<li>Background jobs to clean up orphaned nodes and optimize memory chains</li>\r\n<li>Monitoring graph health and scheduling optimizations as data grows</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=\"bkmrk-we-recommend-beginni\">We recommend beginning with simple, manual reviews and scheduling more advanced jobs as our system and team scale.
