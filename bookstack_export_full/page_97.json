This makes troubleshooting more difficult. This may explain why many developers prefer heavily typed code over vanilla Pythonâ€”static typing and type checking help catch issues early, reducing the risk of hidden runtime errors. Static analysis tools and type hints (like those used with mypy in Python) can help manage this complexity and improve reliability, even in dynamic languages.</p>\n<p id=\"bkmrk-feel-free-to-add-mor\">Feel free to add more details or updates as needed.</p>\n",
